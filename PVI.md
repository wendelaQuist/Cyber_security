## Intro
For my PVI I need to research and investigate technology with possible vulnerabilities. This way I can learn to scan for weak spots in a system and maybe even modify it to my whishes.

#

## Brainstorming
I asked around what kind of project they were going to do, and we gave eachother inspiration. After some ideas I wrote down what I possibly want to research. This means it had to be realistic to achieve, interesting to work with and maybe even usefull.
